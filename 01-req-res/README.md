# Req-Res Example

A simple request-response example. Built on top of express.js

You can run the server by invoking:

```
npm install --save
node server.js
```

After the server runs, you can send a `request` by either:

* Open your browser and type `http://localhost:3000` on the address bar
* Invoking `curl http://localhost:3000`

The server will reply with "Hello world!" `response`.
